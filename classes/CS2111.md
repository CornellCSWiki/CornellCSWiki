## General Information



Currently taught by Gries. That's reason enough to stay away in my opinion.



If you're totally new to Java and have no real OOP background this class could be helpful. I go to a couple occasionally to catchup from lecture when Birman does a bad job.



## Testimonials



I found this painful to attend. I just went to the once-a-week AEW in place of all the 2110 lectures, discussions, and this class, and I was fine. If you think you might have trouble with java take the AEW.
