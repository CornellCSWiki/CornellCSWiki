## Testimonials

Took it last semester-- there were no pop quizzes, despite what the prof said. There were 4 assignments and a final project. Oh, we had a prelim at some point that supposedly worth 5% of our total grade. No actual grades were ever given except for the final grade, and I'm pretty sure everyone who turned in a final project that seemed vaguely related to the course got an A.

It really can be as interesting as you make it. The assignments mainly introduce common software used in CompLing and get you comfortable with it. The final project is totally up to you topic-wise, so the more linguistically inclined students can do something with semantics or grammars, whereas a CS student might look at writing a program that better parses a certain kinds of sentences.
