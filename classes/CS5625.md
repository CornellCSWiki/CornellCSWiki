## Workload

4-5 programming assignments, a final project, and one or two prelims. The assignments can be done individually or in partners, while the final project can be done in groups of 2-5.

## General Advice

Workload throughout the semester wasn't too bad, but assignments can take longer than expected so it is a good idea to start early. This is even more important for the final project because you'll want to have time to make it look polished.
