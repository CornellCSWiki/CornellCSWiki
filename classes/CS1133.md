## Testimonials

Confession: I haven't actually taken this class, but have taken Transition to MATLAB. I was considering taking this class just to get familiar with Python, but then discovered Codecademy's Python course, and took that. In comparison to my other "Transition to x" course, the free site's review of Python was pretty good. I didn't do any extensive projects with the language, but did become familiar with a lot of syntax in a short time. In short, if you're not concerned with racking up CS credits or don't need to take another "Transition to x" requirement, just take the Codecademy course.
