## General Information

MATH 1120, MATH 1220, or MATH 1920 is required to affliate with the CS major. For completeness, their prerequisites (MATH 1110/MATH 1910) are included here.

## Calculus I

 - MATH 1110—Calculus I


## Calculus II

 - MATH 1120—Calculus II

 - MATH 1220—Honors Calculus II
 
 - MATH 1910—Calculus For Engineers

Calculus II classes. MATH 1910 is not enough to afflilate - MATH 1920 is required. The engineers version is usually seen as the most computational, and the honors version is the most theoratical. It doesn't really matter which one you take.

## Multivariable Calculus

 - MATH 1920—Multivariable Calculus for Engineers

## Prerequisites

The order of prerequisites goes:
MATH 1110 - MATH 1120/1220/1910 - MATH 1920

## Topics Covered

Calculus I - Functions of many types, limits, graphing, differentiation
Calculus II - Integration, sequences and series
Multivariable calculus - Differentiation and integration in multiple variables, line integrals, Green's and Stokes' theorems

## Workload

To be filled in.

## General Advice

- If you took AP Math, you should be able to get out of some of the earlier math classes in the sequence.

## Offerings

With the exception of MATH 1220 (Honors Calculus II), every class is offered every semester, sometimes with more than one professor. This list would therefore be unnecessarily long, so refer to the course roster.
