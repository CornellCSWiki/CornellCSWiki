title: CS 2112 - Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures - Honors
layout: article
---

## General Information

An intensive honors version of [[ CS 2110 ]].

## Prerequisites

[[CS 1110]] or AP Credit.

## Topics Covered

Generally the same as [[ CS 2110 ]], but in significantly greater detail. In summary: you use data structures in CS 2110, you implement them yourself in CS 2112.

## Workload

Seven projects, the earlier three of which are individual and the latter four which are paired partner projects that constitute a large "final project." This class requires significantly more work than 2110 and is more comparable to a 3000 level class like [[ CS 3110 ]] or [[ CS 3410 ]].

## General Advice

You will learn significantly more, and if you're serious about Computer Science, this is a much more worthwhile class to take than the non-honors version. That being said, projects are  _very_  long, and many say the class has required 15-35 hours a week of work.

You will not need the book.

2nd prelim and final is open book/note. but it doesn't really help. (FA16 note - wasn't a second prelim nor was the final open book/note)

6000~10000 lines of code for 4~7th project in total

## Testimonials

Highly recommended; if you're on the edge, enroll in it, and switch to [[ CS 2110 ]] if you feel it's too much. (This is encouraged!)

Looking back, I highly recommend taking this course, especially if you intend on majoring in CS. This class definitely prepares you more for upper-level CS classes significantly more than [[ CS 2110 ]] does, and the projects have taught me a lot about proper object-oriented code design. Like said before, if it proves to be difficult, you can always drop into 2110 as there is a process that exists for it, even past the drop deadline.

Fall 2016: 'Failed' the first prelim (6 points below mean) but still finished with an A. My partner did even worse then me but finished with an A+. In general, due to its high median (A-), failing a prelim or two shouldn't affect your grade as long as you are good with your projects. A2 is the hardest assignment and requires careful testing for all parts. A4-A7 are fun and less difficult with a reliable teammate. Overall a really fun class where the projects really taught me a lot, however I should've studied more carefully for prelim 1, especially for those you-think-you-know old stuffs from APCS, and everything on the class notes are important and will appear on the test.
