layout: article
---

## General Information

Learn how open source software and software engineering work by working in teams of 3-6 on a real open source project all semester, with help and advice from industry mentors.

## Prerequisites

You have to submit an application. The professor has said that generally, he has been able to let everyone in who wanted to take it (and was not a freshman or otherwise unprepared), but that changed for Spring 2017.

## Topics Covered

Software Engineering
Free/Open Source Software

## Workload

Semester-long project: you are expected to spend 10-12 hours/week, but it varies a lot based on your project.

You also have a final presentation, and a couple short writing assignments spread across the semester.

## General Advice



## Testimonials

An okay class overall. As someone who has been in open source for a while, I was a little disappointed, though most people really enjoyed the class. This is highly dependent on your project and mentors, though.
