layout: article
---

## General Information

Intermediate website programming class.

## Prerequisites

INFO 1300, but not necessary if you have programming experience.

## Topics Covered

 - PHP
 - MySQL
 - Javascript
 - Ajax
 - XML/JSON

## Workload

A few projects, 2 prelims, and a final project. A3 (when I took it SP11) was the most difficult which included coding from scratch a photo gallery. (S12) Final group project requires you to meet with a Cornell club and create a website for them. Not a bad final project but lots of tedious work. Very similar to a real work scenario when designing a website for someone.

## Testimonials

Went into this class knowing jack squat about design and web programming and ended up getting A+ in course (Skipped CS 1300, but took CS 2110). Really enjoyed this class and learned a lot about web developing quickly! Covers a variety of topics that are very useful when web developing (except we learned PHP which is.... yeah). Recommend this course if you want to learn how to make yourself a kewl website.
