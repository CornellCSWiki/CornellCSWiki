title: CS 2300 - Intermediate Design and Programming for the Web
layout: article
---

## General Information

Intermediate website programming class. 

## Prerequisites

INFO 1300, but not necessary if you have programming experience.

## Topics Covered
 - HTML/CSS (assumes basic knowledge)
 - PHP
 - MySQL
 - JavaScript/JSON
 - AJAX

## Workload

3 major projects, a final project, and a final exam. There are some homework assignments along the way that are distinct from the projects. A3 was the most difficult which included coding from scratch a photo gallery. Final group project requires you to meet with a Cornell club or local organization and create a website for them. Not a bad final project but lots of tedious work. Very similar to a real work scenario when designing a website for someone.

## Testimonials

Went into this class knowing jack squat about design and web programming and ended up getting A+ in course (Skipped CS 1300, but took CS 2110). Really enjoyed this class and learned a lot about web developing quickly! Covers a variety of topics that are very useful when web developing (except we learned PHP which is.... yeah). Recommend this course if you want to learn how to make yourself a kewl website.

Took this class Spring 2015 (and TA'ed Spring 2016) with Steve Mohlke; excellent instructor and a great class. I did [[CS 1300]] the previous semester, which helped significantly with the first few projects. As we got into more PHP it was easy to follow along with lecture and going to course staff for help.
