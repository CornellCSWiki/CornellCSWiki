title: CS 4620 - Introduction to Computer Graphics
layout: article
---

## General Information

## Prerequisites

- [[CS 2110]]
- Basic Knowledge of Vector / Matrix math

4620 requires solid linear algebra, but it's okay to take it concurrently with 2940 if you have to. It is somewhat less work than [[CS 3110]].

## Topics Covered

 - Graphics Pipeline
 - Mesh Generation
 - OpenGL / GLSL
 - Texturing
 - Quaternions
 - Splines
 - Animation
 - Ray Tracing
 - Basic Shading Models (Phong, Blinn Phong, etc)

## Workload

3-4 homeworks: 4-6 hours a piece

3 projects: 10-15 hours a piece

Final raytracer project: 25 hours (broken into 2 parts)

## General Advice

If you're taking the class, it's good to take the practicum as well because it's not significantly more time (3 mid-sized projects) and you do some other cool stuff. You don't really learn much new material (the class meets rarely and when it does, is usually just more office hours), but it will give you a better understanding of things discussed in lecture by having you implement them.

## Testimonials

Graphics is a really fun and rewarding class. By nature, the final results can be shown to anyone and give a greater "cool factor" than say, explaining how you came up with a solution to something in Algorithms. A lot of people take CG for granted in movies, but every single pixel of those special effects scenes is calculated by a ton of complex math. This class gives a glimpse of how all of that is actually put together and created.
