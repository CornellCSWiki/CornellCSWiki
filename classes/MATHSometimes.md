## General Information

Linear algebra or multivariable calculus classes are sometimes required for CS classes.

## Linear Algebra

 - MATH 2210—Linear Algebra
 - MATH 2310—Linear Algebra with Applications
 - MATH 2940—Linear Algebra for Engineers

## Multivariable Calculus

 - MATH 2220—Multivariable Calculus

## Both simultaneously

 - MATH 2230—Theoretical Linear Algebra and Calculus
 - MATH 2240—Theoretical Linear Algebra and Calculus

## Prerequisites

There are three common sequences of classes to take:

Engineers: MATH 1110 - MATH 1910 - MATH 1920 - MATH 2940

"Regular": MATH 1110 - MATH 1120/1220 - MATH 2210 - MATH 2220

Theoretical: MATH 1110 - MATH 1120/1220 - MATH 2230 - MATH 2240

You can mix and match classes as long as they do not overlap - for example, you can take 1120 then 1920, but you cannot count both 1920 and 2210. The overlapping classes are stated quite clearly on the course descriptions.

## Workload

MATH 2210/2230/2940/2220: To be filled in.

MATH 2230/2240: Being the honors versions of linalg and multi, the workload is higher. Expect to write many proofs but do little computational work.

## General Advice

- If you are not sure which sequences of classes to take, the engineers sequence is often seen as more computational and applied while the theoretical version is more proof-heavily and theoretical. The regular sequence lies in between.

## Offerings
With the exception of MATH 2230/2240, every class is offered every semester, sometimes with more than one professor.

This list would therefore be unnecessarily long, so refer to the course roster.
