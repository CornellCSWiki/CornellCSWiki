## General Information

Practicum course associated with [[CS 4700]].

Probably the only practicum course that you can sometimes forget that you're taking.

## Prerequisites

[[CS 4700]] (or corequisite)

## Topics Covered

 - Anything you want, related to AI

## Workload

One project, on whatever you want. You can do as much or as little work as you want. You'll probably still get an A+, though.

## General Advice

If you're pursuing the AI vector, it's required.

Note that the scheduled section only actually meets on the first week.

Pay close attention to who's teaching it. When taught by Hod Lipson, this was a more structured practicum course, with proposals, code reviews, and weekly reports.

With Bart Selman, this qualified as a "course" in the loosest sense of the word.

## Testimonials

Having taken it with Selman, here is all the work I did for this course, and the approximate time I spent on it.

 -  Wrote proposal: 1 hour (also, I never received my proposal back)
 -  Wrote project: 8 hours
 -  Created report and presentation: 6 hours
 -  Gave presentation: 0.5 hours
And yes, I did receive an A+.

(Also, if you think I had it easy, my partner did 0 hours of work and also received an A+.)

This is not an intense practicum course.
