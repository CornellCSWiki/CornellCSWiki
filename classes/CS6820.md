title: CS 6820 - Analysis of Algorithms

## General Information

Lectures can be intense, busy following the proofs while writing them all down. But you're not responsible for all of it, so it's nice to just learn a bunch of cool things.

## Prerequisites

 - [[CS 4820]]

## Topics Covered

Varies wildly, depending on who's teaching the course. See the professor's past websites for their "style" of teaching this course (i.e., Bobby goes for a more combinatorial optimization focus, while Dexter focuses on [[CS 4820 - Introduction to Algorithms|CS 4820]] topics, but at greater depth).

## Workload

Biweekly problem sets. Very interesting problems, but they can get really hard (or impossible) occasionally. Write-up is done collaboratively, which is different from 4820. Having gotten an A in 4820 is highly recommended, but does not imply you will be able to handle the course material, as it often involves current research in the field of Algorithms.

## General Advice

Find a few ugrad/grad students to work together, and have fun bouncing ideas off each other. If you are really stuck, go to OH, and there will be light.

## Testimonials

(Fall 2012) Best CS class at Cornell. Much more theorem proving than [[CS 4820 - Introduction to Algorithms|CS 4820]]. Bobby introduced me to spectral graph theory, which is now my research area! Highly recommend.

I took this with rdk, and I had a lot of fun. Recommend it if you love analyzing/proving algorithms.

(Fall 2010) Very, very fun class. One of the few classes where I was completely engaged every lecture. While the topics are more challenging than [[CS 4820 - Introduction to Algorithms|CS 4820]], it was easier to keep up, since there were fewer homeworks (only 4, for this semester).
