This wiki is cool, right? But you know what would make it even better? Your help! This site was started by students just like you, and we need your help in keeping it up-to-date and adding new content.

## Make a Github Account

Already have one? Skip down to either [Editing a Page](#editing-a-page) or [Making a New Page](#making-a-new-page).

## Editing a Page

If you've heard about Git or Github and how difficult it can't be, don't worry. Github makes it easy with a web interface. Just visit our [repository](https://github.com/CornellCSWiki/testwiki) and find the page you want to edit. Then just hit the edit button!

<!-- TODO: add screenshot of the button. How do I/can I do this from the web interface? -->
<!-- TODO: is there some way to avoid hardcoding the repository link? Maybe use a site variable -->

Github will take care of the Git details for you—in particular, it'll automatically fork the project for you. (Curious? Check out [Forking](#forking) below.) You'll then be presented with an editor where you can make changes to your heart's content. This wiki uses Markdown formatting, which you may have heard of before. We have a quick [guide to Markdown below](#about-markdown).

## Making a New Page

Making a completely new page is pretty simple, too. Like editing a page, just visit our [repository](https://github.com/CornellCSWiki/testwiki) and click *New Page*. To make it easier, we have some templates you can copy:

- [Class info page](#)
- More to come!

## About Markdown

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a simple way to add formatting to plain text documents. You write a document using whatever editor you want, sprinkling in \**asterisks*\* to italicize your text and __ __underscores__ __ to bold it. Some more formatting:

* Lead off with an asterisk or dash to make a list.
    * Indent a few spaces to get a nested one!
* Insert a snippet of code with `` `backticks` ``.

1. You can make numbered lists, too!
1. Markdown automatically numbers the lists for you.

And add a heading with some `## Hashtags`.

## Getting Your Changes Reviewed

At the bottom of the editor, you'll find a place to describe your changes. Github gives you two boxes: one for a short summary of the contribution, and an optional long description. Together, these make a commit message. Write up a little summary of what you did, like "Added page on contributing", "Added median grade to CS 1110 Spring 2015", or "Fixed typos in CS 2112 page". Once you're done, hit "Propose new file". This will make a *pull request* 

Congratulations, you're a contributor! You've just made your first contributions to open source.

## What Next

### Open Source

When you make a contribution, you don't just hand off ownership of your work to us. Everything here is under a *license*, which says what we—and you—can and cannot do with it. In our case, we're using the TODO license, which says TODO. These ideas derive from the *free software movement*, which is about free (as in freedom) software. TODO: extended description.

If you're intrigued, drop by OpenSourceCornell sometime and we'll show you what free & open source software is all about.

### Forking

What is all this Git nonsense anyways?
